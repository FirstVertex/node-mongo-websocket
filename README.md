#Boiler plate stack Node.js & MongoDB & WebSocket server for realtime communication

##What is this ?
A tiny example of a Node.js + MongoDB + Worlize server stack.  It is set up to run on dotCloud.
You can use this as a template for larger applications.

##What you get
In this boiler plate you will find the basic code to get a Node.js, MongoDB, and WebSocket server stack running:
* Use of the dotCoud environment
* Communication with a database: MongoDB, with example insert and select
* Simple `dotCloud.yml` options: node's version, process management.
* Worlize WebSocket server for realtime communication
* Simple Html5 Echo client included which connects to the server
* Demonstrate accepting all origins or restricting realtime connections to the same origin
